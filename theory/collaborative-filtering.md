### Collaborative Filtering

A good canonical dataset for collborative filtering is the movielens dataset, in each row of the dataset, user X watched movie Y and gave it some rating out of 5. There is a many-to-many relationship between movies and users. We can also see the title and genres of the movies.

For some user / movie combo that we haven't seen before, we need to predict how much the user will like the movie.
